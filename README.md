# -Tic-Tac-Toe-in-C-
This is a Tic Tac Toe game I built in C# for a school project. It’s a basic 2-player game where each player takes turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid until someone wins with three in a row or the game ends in a tie. I created the interface using Windows Forms to keep it simple and easy to use.

Project Features
  <br>*2-Player Gameplay: Players can take turns until there’s a winner or a tie.
  <br>*User-Friendly Interface: Made with Windows Forms for a clean, beginner-friendly design.
 <br> *Basic Game Logic: Includes the essential game rules, turn-taking, and win conditions.
This project was a great way to learn C# basics, like working with Windows Forms and handling simple game logic.
