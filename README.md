<h1>Tic Tac Toe in C#</h1>

<p>This is a <strong>Tic Tac Toe game</strong> I built in C# for a school project. It’s a basic 2-player game where each player takes turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid until someone wins with three in a row or the game ends in a tie. I created the interface using <strong>Windows Forms</strong> to keep it simple and easy to use.</p>

<h2>Project Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2-Player Gameplay:</strong> Players can take turns until there’s a winner or a tie.</li>
  <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Made with Windows Forms for a clean, beginner-friendly design.</li>
  <li><strong>Basic Game Logic:</strong> Includes the essential game rules, turn-taking, and win conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project was a great way to learn C# basics, like working with Windows Forms and handling simple game logic. It’s also a fun example for anyone learning <strong>C# programming</strong> and looking for beginner projects in game development!</p>
